#TODO - Add the feature where if score is GREATER than 21, but there is an 11 in the player's hand -> Covert it to a 1 and CONTINUE to draw
##Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
